Solution to a greedy algorithm practice problem from Hackerearth.com.
Problem (Big Travel by Pavel Sheftelevich):
Aarav has just graduated from the university. Now he is going to travel along his country. More precisely: there are N cities with integer coordinates. His plan is to travel between each pair of the cities.

The distance between city A with coordinates (x1, y1) and city B with coordinates (x2, y2) is equal to |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

Now he is interested in the total distance between all the pairs of the cities.

Input
The first line contains one integer N.
The following N lines contain two separated integers (xi, yi) each - coordinates of the corresponding city.

Output
Output one integer - the answer to the question. 
As this number can be very big - output it modulo 10e9 + 7.

Constraints

1 <= N <= 200 000
|xi|, |yi| <= 109
