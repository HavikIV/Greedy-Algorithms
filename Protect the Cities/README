Solution to a greedy algorithm practice problem from Hackerearth.
Problem (Protect the Cities by Archit Rai):
There are N cities in Imaginary Land. The President of Imaginary Land uses the Cartesian coordinates. Each city is located at some point with integer co-ordinates. The President is very careful and concerned about the well-being of the citizens of his country.

For that reason, he wants to create a boundary and cover all the cities inside that boundary. The boundary should in the shape of a square and should be parallel to the coordinate axes. Find the minimum area enclosed by the boundary such that all the cities are on or inside the boundary.

Input:

The first line of the input contains T, denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single positive integer N denoting the number of cities in Imaginary Land.

Each of the next N lines contains two integers xi and yi denoting the coordinates of the ith city.

Output:

For each test-case, output a single non-negative integer denoting the minimum area of the square boundary that encloses all the cities inside or on its boundary.

Constraints:

1≤T≤5
1≤N≤10^5
−10^9≤xi,yi≤10^9.
